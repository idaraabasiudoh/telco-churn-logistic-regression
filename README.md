## Introduction

Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses to monitor, as it indicates the loss of customers over time. This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of a customer churning based on various factors such as tenure, age, income, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

- **tenure**: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company
- **age**: Customer's age in years
- **address**: Number of years the customer has lived at their current address
- **income**: Annual income of the customer
- **ed**: Level of education of the customer
- **employ**: Number of years the customer has been employed
- **equip**: Binary feature indicating whether the customer has the equipment
- **churn**: Target variable indicating if the customer churned (1) or not (0)

## Features

The features are normalized using `StandardScaler` to ensure that the Logistic Regression model performs optimally.

## Modeling

The Logistic Regression model is built using the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is loaded, and the relevant features are selected.
2. **Feature Normalization**: The features are normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
3. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 80:20.
4. **Model Training**: The Logistic Regression model is trained using the training set.
5. **Prediction**: The model is used to predict the churn status of customers in the test set.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Jaccard Index**: A similarity measure between the predicted and actual labels.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix showing the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative counts.
- **Classification Report**: A detailed report showing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
- **Log Loss**: A metric to evaluate the accuracy of probabilistic predictions.

The confusion matrix is also visualized to provide a clearer understanding of the model's performance.
