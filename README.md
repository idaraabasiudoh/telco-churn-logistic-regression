## Telecommunications Churn Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project explores customer churn prediction in the telecommunications industry using Logistic Regression. The code utilizes Python libraries such as `requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn` to download, pre-process, analyze, and evaluate a customer churn dataset.

### Running the Script

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `scikit-learn`).
2. Download and run the script (`churn_prediction.py`).

### Project Overview

The script performs the following steps:

1. Downloads the customer churn dataset from a provided URL.
2. Loads the data into a pandas dataframe.
3. Prepares the data by selecting relevant features, converting data types, and normalizing numerical features.
4. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
5. Builds a Logistic Regression model with hyperparameter tuning.
6. Predicts churn labels and probabilities on the testing set.
7. Evaluates the model performance using Jaccard Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and Log Loss.

### Key Libraries

* **requests**: Downloads the dataset from a URL.
* **pandas**: Loads and manipulates the data as a dataframe.
* **numpy**: Performs numerical computations and array operations.
* **matplotlib.pyplot**: Creates visualizations like the confusion matrix.
* **scikit-learn**: Provides machine learning algorithms and utilities.

### Additional Notes

* The script utilizes standard data pre-processing techniques for machine learning tasks.
* The Logistic Regression model is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability.
* The script provides various performance metrics to evaluate the model's effectiveness in predicting customer churn.

This is a basic example of using Logistic Regression for customer churn prediction. You can further enhance the project by:

* Exploring feature engineering techniques to create new informative features.
* Comparing the performance of Logistic Regression with other classification algorithms.
* Tuning the hyperparameters further to potentially improve the model's accuracy.
* Visualizing the model's coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on churn prediction.

Feel free to explore and customize the script for your specific needs!
